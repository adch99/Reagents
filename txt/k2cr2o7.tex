Hello sir! We can do a lot of things here without too much work.
For example, we can render chemical formulas with ease like
\ce{Au4O9}. We can also write equations easily. But you may not be
comfortable with chemdraw and making diagrams in it, so I am adding
a header image to each reagent's section. You can put all the
diagrams there as images.

Making bullet points is easy.
\begin{itemize}
\item What
\item A
\item Wonderful
\item World!
\end{itemize}

Making numbered ones is easy too.
\begin{enumerate}
\item First we take 100 mL \ce{CCl_4} in a test-tube.
\item Add to it 5 g of amorphous sulphur.
\item Then add a few drops of \ce{Br_2} water.
\end{enumerate}
